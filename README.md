___Copybot___
The original purpose of this program was to retrieve all the elements with something in common of a website and transfer the inner HTML over to a given excel spreadsheet.
Unfortunately, I've not been able to figure out how to copy them over to excel using openpyxl, so for now it just prints the list in the terminal.
But either way it can be easily copied and pasted over.
This is my first official open source project uploaded to github, and as a relatively new and young developer I decided to explain each part as thoroughly as possible
with the intent to aim it at an audience of others like me who are novices to the scene in hopes to inspire and motivate them. I wasn't sure if something like this already existed,
but either way I don't care. All in all, I hope this code can be of use to someone one day, so to anyone who reads this or uses my program, thank you!

___History___
If you're interested in how this idea came into being: my father was stressed with work, and one of the tedious tasks on his list was to create an excel file with all of the 
question ID's from a website in order to write comments of corrections made next to the question being reffered to. My mom and I offered up our aid to at least help him by copying
the question ID's to the file. Soon, due to the enormous amount of questions (around 2,000) and in combination with the fact that the question ID's weren't already in a
vertical list so they could be easily copied and pasted, I realized it was an unfeasable endeavor to finish in a day and a half. Consequently, I took it upon myself to attempt to build this
bot. Regrettably, it took longer than expected and thus, I was unable to finish the bot on time. Putting that aside, and knowing the deadline had already passed,
I wanted to complete the project. After hours of learning and coding invested in this project, I felt that the copybot could have a greater purpose, so I created a github and
stack overflow account to kickstart my career as a (currently novice) software developer.
