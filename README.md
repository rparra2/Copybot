___Copybot___
The purpose of this program is to retrieve all the elements of a website that have something in common and transfer the inner HTML over to a given excel spreadsheet. This is my first official open source project uploaded to github, and as a relatively new and young developer I decided to explain each part as thoroughly as possible
with the intent to aim it at an audience of others like me who are novices to the scene in hopes to inspire and motivate them. I wasn't sure if something like this already existed, but either way I don't care, I just want to learn. Also, I would like to thank a former classmate and friend of mine Daniel Mu√±oz for his contribution and dedication to this project by writing up the code that copies the data over to excel. All in all, I hope this code can be of use to someone one day, so to anyone who reads this or uses my program, thank you!

___Requirements___
To successfully execute the full program you must have:
- Selenium
- Some type of webdriver (usually chromedriver)
- Pandas (a python package)
- An excel file in csv format (instead of the usual xlsx file extension)

___History___
If you're interested in how this idea came into being: my father was stressed with work, and one of the tedious tasks on his list was to create an excel file with all of the 
question ID's from a website in order to write comments of corrections made next to the question being reffered to. My mom and I offered up our aid to at least help him by copying
the question ID's to the file. Soon, due to the enormous amount of questions (around 2,000) and in combination with the fact that the question ID's weren't already in a
vertical list so they could be easily copied and pasted, I realized it was an unfeasable endeavor to finish in a day and a half. Consequently, I took it upon myself to attempt to build this bot. Regrettably, it took longer than expected and thus, I was unable to finish the bot on time. Putting that aside, and knowing the deadline had already passed,
I wanted to complete the project. After hours of learning and coding invested in this project, I felt that the copybot could have a greater purpose, so I created a github and
stack overflow account to kickstart my career as a (currently novice) software developer.
